# Attack Paths and Commands (APComs)

Access the tool [here](https://josh-vr.github.io/APComs/).

APComs is a web based tool that I’ve created to help me with studying for the OSCP exam. It contains useful and common commands that I have utilized in every stage of practicing penetration testing on websites such as HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and VulnHub - from reconnaissance to post-exploitation. In addition to commands, there are several “paths” that I’ve put - they’re not commands but rather tools, or things you could check for that will assist you. Commands/paths are organized in a table based on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and you can filter them based on a search or section.

tl/dr: APComs (Attack Paths and Commands) is a cheatsheet of commands/paths for penetration testing - filter by using the search functionality and/or section filters.
